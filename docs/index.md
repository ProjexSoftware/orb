ORB
====================

Welcome to ORB, a new kind of database ORM.  Similar to `SQLAlchemy` and
`Storm`, the `ORB` framework will allow Python model defintiion for database communication abstraction.

This project, however, also aims to be a more feature rich and object-oriented API builder than
just a model generation system.  With a Pythonic Query model system, building complex database queries
becomes much easier to use.

On top of the standard code-based schema definitions, the
`Orbiter` editor will also provide a graphical UML interface for quickly designing and laying out
the data definitions.

Installation
------------------

You can install `orb` using either `pip` or `easy_install`.

    $ easy_install projex_orb

Source Code
