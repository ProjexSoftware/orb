Installation
-----------------------

If you would like to use the latest build that has been tested and published,
you can use the Python `setuptools` to install it to your computer or virtual
environment:

    $ easy_install projex_orb

If you would like to use the latest code base, you can clone the repository
and reference your `PYTHONPATH` to the checkout location, or make a build
of the code by using the `projex.xbuild` system:

    $ cd /path/to/git/orb
    $ python /path/to/projex/scripts/xbuild.py ./orb.xbuild
